A Claude Code **status line** for [vast.ai](https://vast.ai) GPU usage. It shows how many
instances are up, your **running compute** vs **stopped-storage** burn, your account balance, and
how long that balance lasts at the total burn — as one extra line under whatever status line you
already run (e.g. [quotaline](https://github.com/Entrolution/quotaline)).

![vastline status line — quotaline's model/effort/ctx/mem header and 5-hour and weekly usage bars, then a vast line showing running/total instances, running compute burn, stopped-instance storage burn, account balance, and the runway until the balance runs out](assets/demo.svg)

The bottom line is vastline; the lines above it are quotaline, which vastline delegates to and
leaves untouched. It reads only two vast.ai endpoints with a **read-only scoped key**, and does
it off the render path so your prompt never blocks on the network.

## What it shows

- **`1/2 up`** — running instances / total instances.
- **`run $0.57/hr`** — burn rate of the instances that are actually *running* (`dph_total`, which
  already includes their storage). Shown only when something is running.
- **`store $0.01/hr`** — storage still billing on *stopped-but-not-destroyed* instances. Shown
  only when it's non-zero (you have stopped instances quietly costing storage).
- **`bal $15.62`** — account credit (red if ≤ 0).
- **`~27h`** — runway: how long the balance lasts at the **total** burn (running + storage).
  Amber under 12h, red under 4h. Computed from total burn deliberately — a stopped fleet still
  bleeds storage, so a runway based on running burn alone would read as falsely infinite.

Degrades quietly: no key → a one-line setup hint; an empty fleet → `vast  idle · bal $15.62`;
everything stopped → `vast  0/1 up · store $0.01/hr · bal $15.62 · ~73d`; a stale or failed
refresh → the last good numbers, dimmed, with a marker.

## Why running and storage burn are shown separately

vast.ai keeps an instance's `dph_total` (its full per-hour compute rate) reported even after you
**stop** it — but a stopped instance is only billed for *storage*, which is dramatically cheaper
(an A100 at `$0.57/hr` running drops to `~$0.01/hr` of disk when stopped). Summing `dph_total`
across all instances would therefore massively overstate the drain of a stopped fleet and report
a runway of hours when it's really weeks. So vastline bills running instances at `dph_total` and
stopped instances at their storage rate (`storage_total_cost`), shows the two components
separately, and computes the runway from their honest sum.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Entrolution/vastline/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the binary to `~/.local/bin` and runs `vastline install`, which wires it into
`~/.claude/settings.json`. If you already have a status line (like quotaline), vastline
**captures it and delegates to it** — your existing line keeps working, with the vast line added
underneath. (Windows: use `install.ps1`.)

Then add a **read-only** API key:

```sh
# Mint a least-privilege key (needs the vast CLI once; read-only scopes only):
vastai create api-key --name vastline \
  --permissions '{"api": {"instance_read": {}, "user_read": {}}}'

vastline key set      # paste the key when prompted (never touches shell history)
```

If you already use the `vastai` CLI, vastline will reuse its key automatically — `key set` is
optional.

## Uninstall

```sh
vastline uninstall            # restores your previous status line verbatim; keeps key + cache
vastline uninstall --purge    # also removes the stored key, captured base, and cache
```

Both back up `settings.json` first and restore the exact block vastline captured at install
time — so removing vastline leaves quotaline (or whatever you had) exactly as it was.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vastline` | Render the status line (default; reads Claude Code's JSON on stdin). |
| `vastline refresh` | Fetch the API and rewrite the cache (run automatically in the background). |
| `vastline status` | Show the resolved key and a live fetch — for confirming a new key works. |
| `vastline key set [KEY]` | Store a read-only key (prompted/stdin if omitted; chmod 600). |
| `vastline key path` | Show which key would be used and from where. |
| `vastline key clear` | Remove vastline's stored key (leaves the vast CLI's key alone). |
| `vastline install [--refresh N]` | Wire into `settings.json` (default refresh 10s). |
| `vastline uninstall [--purge]` | Restore the previous status line; `--purge` drops key + cache. |

## How it stays off the render path

Claude Code runs the status-line command every few seconds. vastline's render **never** calls
the network: it reads a cached snapshot (`~/.claude/vastline/state.json`) and prints instantly.
If that snapshot is older than 60s it spawns a detached `vastline refresh` to update it for next
time, guarded by a short-lived lock so a burst of render ticks can't stampede the API. The only
thing that talks to vast.ai is `refresh`, via the system `curl` — so there's no TLS stack linked
into the binary, and deps stay limited to serde.

## Key resolution

First match wins:

1. `$VAST_API_KEY` — environment (CI / ephemeral shells).
2. `~/.config/vastline/vast_api_key` — what `vastline key set` writes.
3. `~/.config/vastai/vast_api_key` — the official CLI's key, reused if present.

`vastline key path` always tells you which one is in effect, so a stale env var can't silently
shadow the key you think you set.

## Configuration (env)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `VAST_API_KEY` | API key (highest-priority source). |
| `VAST_URL` | Override the API base (default `https://console.vast.ai/api/v0`). |
| `VASTLINE_CONFIG_DIR` | Override `~/.config/vastline` (key + captured base). |
| `VASTLINE_STATE_DIR` | Override `~/.claude/vastline` (cache). |
| `CLAUDE_SETTINGS` | Override the `settings.json` path install/uninstall edit. |

## Security

vastline is designed around a **read-only scoped key**: `instance_read` + `user_read`, nothing
else. A leaked key of this scope exposes your instance list and balance — it cannot spin up
instances, spend money, or destroy anything. Don't point vastline at your account-wide master
key. The key file is written `chmod 600`.
